# Squishy.js
## by Chris Sauv√© of [pxldot](http://pxldot.com)

Squishy is a jQuery plugin that automatically resizes text to exactly fit the container with no extra work on your part.

You can pass the script a number of options to restrict the squishiness. `maxSize` is used to set the maximum font size, `minSize` is used to set the minimum font size, `maxWidth` sets the maximum width of the line of text, and `minWidth`, the minimum (all in pixels, for now).

Much thanks to the guys at [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com/) for their work on [FitText](http://fittextjs.com/), on which this script is largely based. This plugin only works for a single line; if you are looking for multiline text fitting, I recommend [SlabText](http://www.frequency-decoder.com/demo/slabText/).

You can view a demo on the [project page](http://cmsauve.com/labs/squishy) for this plugin.
